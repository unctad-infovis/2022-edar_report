        <h3>CHAPTER 2: Trade in services: A niche for export diversification in Africa</h3>
        <h4>Services play a critical role in global and regional value chains and international trade. They represent the main source of value added in total trade, as they contribute to the physical and digital connectivity of all sectors within and across economies.</h4>

        <p>The development of trade in services enhances inclusive growth by reducing poverty and inequality and fosters the achievement of Agenda 2063 and the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
        <p>Africa can leverage trade in services to diversify economic activities into new and potentially transformative sectors.</p>
        <h5>Traditional services dominate trade</h5>
        <p>Currently, trade in services is low in Africa. Between 2005 and 2019, services made up only 17% of the continent’s exports. Travel and transport accounted for about two thirds, representing a high concentration of traditional service sectors.</p>
        <p>In comparison, high-income countries rely mostly on high-knowledge intensive services, such as financial, business, insurance or intellectual property services.</p>
        <p>African services exports within the region and with the rest of the world are largely made up of traditional services (about 70%). High knowledge-intensive services represent only 20% of total services exports in Africa.</p>
        <p>Traditional services don’t have a direct impact on the complexity and diversity of the export basket, which is seen to increase with high knowledge-intensity services such as ICT.</p>

        <p>Some countries have made progress in diversifying their services. In 2005–2019, the top three services sectors represented less than 70% of total exports in services in five countries: Burkina Faso, Kenya, Malawi, Senegal and Sierra Leone.</p>
        <p>Exports in services remain dominated by travel and transport in most African countries, except in a few countries such as Malawi, where the primary services sector is telecommunications, representing one fourth of total exports in services.</p>

        <p>The key factors undermining trade in services in Africa include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The high cost of trade in services</li>
          <li>Protectionist policies and measures</li>
          <li>Infrastructure and equipment issues </li>
          <li>Low levels of digitalization and technology</li>
          <li>Difficult access to financial services</li>
          <li>Poor regional integration </li>
          <li>A limited competitive environment</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Lead role of the private sector</h5>
        <p>The private sector is the cornerstone of most economies in Africa. The role of the private sector in diversifying and upgrading export patterns, in attracting investment in growth sectors or in stimulating innovation in domestic industries, productivity and exports has helped develop and strengthen the economic fibre of many advanced countries and emerging markets.</p>
        <p>In many developing countries, particularly in Africa, the potential role of the private sector is often limited due to financial constraints and other challenges hindering business growth and survival likelihood, as well as its contribution to trade and productivity in domestic markets.</p>
        <p>Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in particular have an increasing potential in facilitating trade in services and hence, the development of value chains in Africa. They represent about 90% of enterprises in the region and employ about 60% of the workforce.</p>
        <p>African SMEs can create more opportunities for sustained growth, trade diversification and competitiveness in high value added and growth services sectors, such as tourism and travel, as well as ICT services.</p>
        <p>But the multiple barriers facing African SMEs need to be tackled. For example, Africa has about 50 million formal SMEs, which can help diversify the continent’s exports, but they have an unmet financing need of $416 billion every year, according to the International Finance Corporation.</p>
        <p>Firms, in particular new entrants and small-scale exporting companies, need to secure external financing to cover the large costs of entering export markets.</p>
        <p>Other obstacles affecting the use of services by African firms and the integration of SMEs in the sector include infrastructure and competitiveness challenges, the cost of increased informality and the need for increased skills in high knowledge-intensive sectors.</p>
